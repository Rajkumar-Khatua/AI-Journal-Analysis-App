Hey there!

Just a heads up that this project is still being worked on, so there might be a few kinks to iron out. The features we mentioned earlier aren't quite ready yet, but we're getting close!

If you run into any bugs or have some ideas on how to make things better, feel free to let us know! You can create a new issue in the project repository, or just shoot me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RajkumarKh18976) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajkumarkhatua/).

This project is in its very early stages, and my focus right now is on building a solid backend. But that doesn't mean I'm not open to ideas! If you've got some thoughts on how to make the UI amazing, feel free to share them by creating an issue or just letting me know.

Cheers! ðŸš€
